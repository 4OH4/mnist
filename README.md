# mnist
Ground-up neural-network to classify MNIST handwritten digits, not bleeding edge by any definition

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x with numpy installed
- MNIST database from http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/ (plus uncompress) in local folder to code

## .nn file format
Describes a fully connected neural network, N layers (1<N<256). First layer has no weights and biases, input from external only.

Binary data, little endian
